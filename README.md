# JavaScript Course

### What I learned

While I was working through this project I learned to work with JavaSCript. I learned the basics.

I also learned how to use clases, objects, functions, etc.

};

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaAkV--25fg&t=192s) - This helped me write more readable css and html code. I really liked this methodology and will use it going forward.
